## How to use Mockbox
Start by adding textures to your box by drag-and-dropping (or manually upload via the face selection window) images onto a face. By default, the cube will automatically scale to match your textureâ€™s aspect ratio, but you can also adjust this manually.

Customize your scene by adjusting environment settings like background, lighting, and FOV, and experiment with animation settings such as rotation axis, speed, and easing.

Once you're ready, click the download button to download a still image, or press play and screen-record your screen for a looping animation.
